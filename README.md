# Social Token Platform eg.. Friend.Tech

A blockchain-agnostic social token ecosystem that transforms creator influence into tradable digital assets. This platform enables content creators, influencers, and experts to monetize their online presence through tokenized access keys that grant holders exclusive privileges including private chats, personalized advice, and premium content. By creating a direct economic relationship between creators and their communities, the platform eliminates traditional intermediaries while providing transparent, market-driven valuation of social capital.
